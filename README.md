# Project info

The aim of this project is to create a website service that enables users to search and maintain “Public Market Information” provided by DATA.GOV.HK. This project is based on the ATWD1 coursework and involves the redevelopment of the client application using an MVC framework. The client-side application will provide search, delete, update, and create functions to maintain and serve data, while still utilizing the RESTful server that has already been developed.
